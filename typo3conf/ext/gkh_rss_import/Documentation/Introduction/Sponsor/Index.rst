Help supporting further development
===================================
This extension and manual has been created in endless hours, mostly by a single person.
It is actively maintained to fit all supported TYPO3 versions, user interface concepts and best practice approaches.

If this extension helps you in anyway to achieve your requirements, please think about giving something back.
You want to sponsor a feature to extend something that's already there? Then find some ideas to make me happy below - I'm looking forward to get in contact with you!
